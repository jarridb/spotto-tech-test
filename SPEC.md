# Spotto Technical Assessment: Cloud Resource Tagging System

## Who we are building for

### FinOps (Financial Operations) is a discipline that combines finance, operations, and engineering to manage cloud costs effectively. A FinOps analyst is responsible for:
- Cost visibility & allocation: Understanding where cloud spending goes across teams, projects, and business units
- Chargeback/showback: Accurately billing internal teams for their cloud resource usage
- Cost optimization: Identifying waste, rightsizing resources, and finding savings opportunities
- Budgeting & forecasting: Predicting future cloud costs based on usage patterns
- Governance & compliance: Ensuring resources follow organizational tagging policies


##  Your interpretation of the "Tag Coverage Dashboard" requirement
To understand what a tag coverage dashboard is did a search on What is a "FinOps Analyst?", this has been added above under the who section

This helps me to define what Tag coverage is:
Tag coverage refers to how the resources are tagged how the usage is mesaured, are they compliant or not. If a resource is not tagged correctly then it will be non compliant and finops would not be able to allocate costs.

After looking at hte data I would see that the things a finops would look for in coverage are:
1. per resource - is each resource compliant or not, do they have required tags
2. overall - what % or resources are compliant
3. per tag - which resources have each tag
4. cost-weighted - what % of spend is properly tagged
